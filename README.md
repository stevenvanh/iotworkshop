# iotworkshop

The original lab by Microsoft requires an Azure Subscription and a Grove Pi+. The Sense Hat variation that we use for this IoT workshop does not require an Azure subscription, but you can use one to build the lab out later. As an alternative for the hardware based lab you can also use virtual devices that allow you to run your own code.
